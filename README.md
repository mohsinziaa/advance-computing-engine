# advance-computing-engine

In this project we had to design a processor with a minimum number of instructions to per
form the basic arithmetic, logic, shift, I/O and program control instructions. 
This includes:
1. Designing an original/novel instruction set architecture (ISA)
along with the sequence of
microoperations and a unique bin
ary encoding for each instruction
2. Defining the instruction formats and addressing modes.
3. Deciding what size of memory is required.
4. Deciding how many and what registers the processor should have.
5. Complete CPU design and the design of the system bus.
6. Control of Registers, Flags and Memory
7. Interrupts initiated or Program Controlled I/O
8. Complete computer description.

You may follow the Basic Computer design but your design must not be completely identical to the
Basic Computer. Students will earn maximum marks if their instruction set is substantially unlike any
design studied in the class. Students who design a simulator (e.g., similar to the Three-bit
Opcode Processor simulator) to show how the instructions are fetched and executed will receive a di
stinctive grade. Note, however, that providing a simulator is not mandatory.
Those who are submitting a simulator must also submit a separate documentation/manual along with the simulator to expla
in its working
